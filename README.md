# Shortcuts
Welcome to my Shortcuts repository! This repository represents a comprehensive list and details of all Apple shortcuts I've developed till date.

To download my shortcuts, just click on the banner within each README file. You can also find my shortcuts published on [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/user/MrJeevs).

Feel free to leave any feedback (*questions, bugs, features*) on my shortcuts! To do so, create a *New issue* in the [Issues](https://github.com/MrJeevs/Shortcuts/issues) tab.
